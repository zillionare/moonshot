Alphalens lacks accurate monthly factor testing; our library delivers it.

## Overview

Moonshot is a lightweight, efficient Python package designed specifically for monthly factor-based investment strategy backtesting. **Unlike existing tools such as Alphalens, which has limitations in monthly factor analysis**, Moonshot provides a clean, intuitive API for evaluating factor performance through monthly portfolio rebalancing, making it ideal for quantitative researchers and portfolio managers working with factor investing strategies.

### Why Moonshot?

**Addressing Alphalens Limitations**: While Alphalens is a popular choice for factor analysis, it has known issues with monthly factor evaluation, particularly in handling monthly rebalancing logic and date alignment. Moonshot was specifically designed to address these shortcomings.

Unlike general-purpose backtesting frameworks, Moonshot is specifically crafted for monthly factor strategies. It eliminates the complexity of configuring generic backtesting engines while providing the precision needed for factor research. **Most importantly, it ensures accurate monthly factor analysis where other tools fall short.**

The name "Moonshot" reflects our ambition to help researchers and practitioners aim high in their factor investing endeavors - taking calculated risks for potentially significant returns, with the confidence that comes from accurate analysis.
